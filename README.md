# PureDarwin GNU `libtool`

This repository contains a copy of GNU `libtool` version 2.4.6 in the `gnulibtool`
subdirectory. The [top-level `Makefile`](./Makefile) is designed to integrate the
Autoconf-based build system used by `libtool` into the `darwinbuild`-based system
used to build PureDarwin.
